Notes:
  - 62 Tests %96.88 Coverage
  - Refactored significantly to reduce repetition but originally built the project with standard controller methods. Can speak to and explain the design decisions and really pushed to experiment with better/faster/dryer ways to organize data.
  - Created "SuperController" to handle repetition.
