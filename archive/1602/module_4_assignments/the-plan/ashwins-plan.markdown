### Which Assignments and Why?
- Which assignments did you choose to complete this week?

I chose and completed the goal setting and job hunt exercises because I just wanted to be able to cross things off my list, including assignments that are optional/unncessary for points.

- Why did you choose these assignments?

See above

- What am I actually going to do?

I have a list of six things I want to be spending my time doing:

	1. hackerrank algorithmic thinking
	
	2. clojure
	
	3. job searching
	
	4. performance review rebuild and deploymentp
	
	5. jasmine-rails documentation
	
	6. compilers
