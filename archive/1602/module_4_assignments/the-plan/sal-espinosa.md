### Which Assignments and Why?
- Which assignments did you choose to complete this week?
- Why did you choose these assignments?
* The Plan: Required, but also feels like a good starting point. Got a chance to think about what I want to study.
* Side Hustle: Feel like this is something that Pindell has talked about for a long time, so it's been on my mind. I had been writing notes about ideas, but it was nice to be able to get a little more specific with them.
