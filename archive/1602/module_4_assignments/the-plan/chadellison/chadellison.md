### Which Assignments and Why?
- Which assignments did you choose to complete this week?
* Goal Assignment
* Job Stalking Assignment
- Why did you choose these assignments?
I chose the the goal assignment because it was required :)
I chose the Job Stalking assignment because finding a job is a top priority and I
knew this would work towards that goal. Moreover, I don't think I will have a
difficult time continuing to code because it is much more fun than doing job stuff.

### Submitted Assignments

Link to or paste in **two** completed assignments below.

## Goals
Three learning goals for the next year

* 1 Learn a new Language or Framework-- currently leaning towards REACT, Ember.js, or Angular / get better at JavaScript
* 2 Deploy something with Docker
* 3 Use AWS for future apps

Current progress with:
* 1: I've built a few applications in pure JavaScript and several with a Rails backend and JavaScript front end.
* 2: Almost no progress--I barely have a high level understanding of Docker
* 3: Almost no progress--I barely have a high level understanding of Docker

In One Year success will be:
* 1: building at least two applications in (REACT, Ember.js, or Angular), and building several more in JS.
* 2: Deploying at least one application in Docker
* 3: Using AWS for at least three applications

Resources for learning
* 1: I want to stay in touch with my mentor Trey about dev ops related goals
* 2: I want to stay in touch with my other mentor, Jay, and seek out working on a project with him
* 3: I want to go between 2 and 3 meet-ups a week.
* 4: Read the book "A smarter way to learn JavaScript"

This Goal is important to me because I want to have marketable skills and I believe having strong Rails skills
with strong JavaScript skills will allow me to build just about anything with the proper tools.
