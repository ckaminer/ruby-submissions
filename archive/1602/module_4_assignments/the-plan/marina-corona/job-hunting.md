Glass Door Review for Naked Apartments:

No Offer
Neutral Experience
Average Interview
Application
I applied online. I interviewed at Naked Apartments.

Interview
I had a phone screening, followed by a technical phone interview. I was sent a 'decline' email after the phone interview.

I feel mostly neutral about the experience, though I went out of the phone interview feeling unexcited about the role. I felt the interviewer could have shown a little more enthusiasm, but maybe that's just me. Who knows. Overall, it was an alright experience.

Interview Questions
How would you refactor this small program?
