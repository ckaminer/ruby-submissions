### Blog draft

Didn't really have time/ideas for an outline this week.

Want to write a blog post on how we decide to approach authentication and authorization through an external api. I've been doing a lot of reading without finding any kind of consistency on best practices or a good way to do this. So I want to outline the approach we take, what went well, what went wrong, and would I make this decision again.

I'm hoping to really dig into that issue this weekend and start on the blog post then.

### Hours

Document your general hours below (or planned hours)

- Mon (4 hours):
- Tuesday (8.75 hours):
- Wednesday (6 hours):
- Thursday (7 hours): Planned
- Friday (4 hours):
- Weekend (4 hours): Planned

Had a bit of a busy week with some meetings and phonecalls. Planning to make up for it Friday and Saturday and take Sunday off.

### Participation

Made some comments on PRs, Mostly just small code spikes this week so didn't have a ton of code to review.
Mostly I suggested people add readmes with project descriptions and instructions for running the project.

Specifically Patrick and Ling look like they are working on cool things, but I have no idea what it is.

Me and Mark talked a ton this week, mostly discussions about technologies and stack we wanted to use for the project.
We are both excited to work with Ember, but had a lot of discussions on what our back end should consist of.
We had a lot of good discussion about express and firebase, ultimately we decided to go with a Rails API. We decided on
this mostly to limit the new technologies needed to be learned. Learning Ember is already a lot of work and we wanted to make sure we could have a MVP completed by the end of the two weeks. A major driver for our decision, was that we thought the more technologies we used not specifically taught at Turing, the less likely it was that future students would be willing to pick up the project, or make meaningful progress in two weeks.
