### Participation

Not as involved as I could have been in [this one](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor/pull/107#issuecomment-233805627) (other than closing it)

[This one was mine](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor/pull/108), so I was involved a bit more. I responded to comments with both explanations and changes as appropriate.

### Work / Research Completed

###### Work
[PR diff showing all I did to implement the new API endpoint (I know, I know, it's _really_ impressive)](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor/pull/108/files)  
[Attempt at error tracking (In it's current state)](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor/commit/fd309546fb3841760502a62dcc178e7ebd2c10ee)  

###### Research
[Gem I've bee trying to use for error tracking (seems like it should have been easy...)](http://smartinez87.github.io/exception_notification/)  
[Other Gem involved that the first relies on](https://github.com/stevenosloan/slack-notifier)  
[SO question that made me reconsider life choices](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9391447/how-to-use-newrelic-to-monitor-rails-exceptions)  
At this point, it may just be easier to show you my search history from yesterday. It's long and dense on this topic.
