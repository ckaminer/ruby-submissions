### Participation

I've reviewed the pull-requests made by [our team](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingForFrontEnd/pull/61) and the [back-end team](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor/pull/108), and have participated in several face to face conversations with the back-end team about what we needed from the new end-point they built. Many of the conversations surrounding our team's pull request have resulted in new issues- which seems cool.

### Work Completed
