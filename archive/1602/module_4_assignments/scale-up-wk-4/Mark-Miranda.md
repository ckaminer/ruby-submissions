### Participation

- [pr comment](https://github.com/theonlyrao/alpha_animate/pull/7/files#diff-fa3ed1d141a851338dbe81febdda1330)
  - I haven't made a ton of comments on PRs. I've been hyper-focused on learning different flavors of JS and iteration planning. I realize that this isn't necessarily a fully valid excuse, but I think the work on the 'ship warrants more attention because it's a full rebuild.

### Work Completed

- Research
- Yo Ember
- Rails 5 API

- [mentorShip - Front End](https://github.com/turingMentorSHIP/MentorSHIP-FrontEnd)
  - Mostly CSS at the moment, working on getting styles in place and ready for when the API is up and ready to go.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (50 points)

Instructor/Developer will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.

  * 50: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature or well documented spike. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.

### Feedback
- don't let the api stop you. If worst comes to worse create fake data (stubbing or having like a json data object) rendered to the page so we can just plug things in.
