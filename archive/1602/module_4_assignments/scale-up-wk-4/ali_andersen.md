### Participation

Speak to your participation in PRs (links would be nice) and in your project groups.  
*https://github.com/turingMentorSHIP/MentorSHIP-FrontEnd/pull/1  
*Tino Esperanza* - was a huge help assisting me trouble shooting. Even though he couldn't help me figure it out. The process of elimination of what could be wrong led me to find the solutions. Mad Shout out to Tino(1412).

### Work Completed
The past few days have been nothing but tutorials mostly focused on React, my main obstacle that took me over 7 hours to figure out was the trouble Shooting of Android Studio. Finally after overcoming this on Tuesday I spent Tuesday night and Wednesday going over React.native tutorials and am very happy to report I was able to get an API!!!!!!! However with that said I was not able to grab the API's I needed from my website. Not sure why, I think its a http versus an https thing. This week has been challenging by far, I am use to being able to produce some sort of progress in building my app. However with a language so new and very little guidance, I haven't been able to get the app going yet. The stress is high as I have only a week to finish this project and work this entire weekend and also have a code challenge to do...

# Instructor feedback

150/150 points

### Blog Post Draft (25 Points)  

  * 25: Developer has **draft/outlines** for 2 small blog posts documenting something they have worked on for their independent study or one in depth blog post. Outline is reasonably in depth and shows research/thoughtfullness.

### Team Participation (50 points)

  * 50: Developer participated daily in stand ups with the group (remote or in person). Developer was able to speak to their work in stand ups in a way that was clear and informative. Developer was involved in pull request reviews.

### Hourly Work (25 points)

  * 25: Developer logged 7 to 8 hours per working day (or has a plan to do so over the weekend). Developer can speak to work completed during those hours.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (50 points)

Instructor/Developer will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.
 - React Native with APIs and Android platforms are hard. Props for going for it. 
  * 50: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature or well documented spike. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.

- Weekend Plans:
 - Troubleshooting and how to hit internal API, might redirect to a new simpler plan.
