### Participation

I mostly forgot all about PRs in my code coma.  I looked at a few but didn't know enough about React/Ember to offer anything useful.  Also, I'm not super proud of the code I've written so I'm not keen to show it to everyone.  But I'll just suck it up and make an effort to comment on something.

I have been at every stand up/ submitted a remote stand up description when I had to meet my mentor.  

And I also made [this](http://g.recordit.co/SBNpeIUcme.gif)

Have a working but not yet tested or published Omniauth strategy gem, see repo [here](https://github.com/kristindiannefoss/omniauth_teamsnap).

Started a sample app with it: [Snap Me Up](https://github.com/kristindiannefoss/snap_me_up/pull/1)
