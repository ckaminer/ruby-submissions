### Participation

I personally couldn't submit a worthwhile pull request.

I honestly did look at 3 other pull requests but two of them were from looking for and had in depth conversations and I didn't feel like I could add anything worthwhile. I did talk with Patrick a little bit about his pull request in person, but more to understand what he was doing so I could be further help later.
