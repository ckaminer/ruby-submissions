# Instructor feedback

### Week 4

150/150 points

### Blog Post Draft (25 Points)  

  * 25: Developer has **draft/outlines** for 2 small blog posts documenting something they have worked on for their independent study or one in depth blog post. Outline is reasonably in depth and shows research/thoughtfullness.

### Team Participation (50 points)

  * 50: Developer participated daily in stand ups with the group (remote or in person). Developer was able to speak to their work in stand ups in a way that was clear and informative. Developer was involved in pull request reviews.

### Hourly Work (25 points)

  * 25: Developer logged 7 to 8 hours per working day (or has a plan to do so over the weekend). Developer can speak to work completed during those hours.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (50 points)

Instructor/Developer will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.
 - Diving into poorly documented territory for fixing a bug to render components in new tabs that only works on dev. 

  * 50: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature or well documented spike. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
