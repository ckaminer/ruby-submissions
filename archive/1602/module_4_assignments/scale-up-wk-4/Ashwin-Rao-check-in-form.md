# Scale Up Week 4 Submission Form

[Project Spec: Whiskey Tango](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/independent_study_project.markdown)

# Student Feedback

### Blog topics

1. **How to create CSS shapes** - detailed look at what the `border-top`, `border-left`, and `border-bottom` attributes are doing in the css. There are several sites that use these attributes, but I haven't found a good explanation of what's going on with them anywhere.

2. **How to animate CSS shapes** - I think that animating the transition from one letter to another will require setting the starting and ending attributes of the shapes, controlling the transition, and setting a trigger. As a result, it would make for a useful smaller post.

# Instructor feedback

### Week 4

150/150 points

### Blog Post Draft (25 Points)  
 - No physical outline but has an organized plan for topics
  * 25: Developer has **draft/outlines** for 2 small blog posts documenting something they have worked on for their independent study or one in depth blog post. Outline is reasonably in depth and shows research/thoughtfullness.

### Team Participation (50 points)

  * 50: Developer participated daily in stand ups with the group (remote or in person). Developer was able to speak to their work in stand ups in a way that was clear and informative. Developer was involved in pull request reviews.

### Hourly Work (25 points)

  * 25: Developer logged 7 to 8 hours per working day (or has a plan to do so over the weekend). Developer can speak to work completed during those hours.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (50 points)

Instructor/Developer will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.
 - Express/Server/Routing which is totally unneccessary but a really good risk to take
 - Also chose not to use a starter kit
 
  * 50: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature or well documented spike. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
