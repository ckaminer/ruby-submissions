I haven't done as much PR participation as I would like, though I have spent some time helping people in person with Node and socket related questions.  I spent at least 30 minutes working with Chad yesterday on his Poker game trying to figure out some Action Cable things.  It was pretty interesting, though I'm not in love with the way Action Cable works.
