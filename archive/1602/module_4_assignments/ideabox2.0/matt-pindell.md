## Completion

### Were you able to complete the base functionality?
* Basically, although the search functionality extends beyond just Title and Body.

# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
* [Semi-Proud Code](https://github.com/pindell-matt/idea_box/blob/5883a6c443626eff5fd340500045dab77e629713/app/controllers/api/v1/ideas_controller.rb#L16-25)
* I felt that this was adequately clean.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
* [Non-Proud Code](https://github.com/pindell-matt/idea_box/blob/5883a6c443626eff5fd340500045dab77e629713/app/assets/javascripts/ideas.js#L1-44)
* Still new to JS, but this just doesn't feel correct in terms of style. Wish I had been able to untangle the gordian knot and seperate some of this code out into separate files.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

## Instructor Evaluation Points

### Specification Adherence

* **10 points**: 

### User Interface

* **5 points** - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

### Testing

* **10 points** - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels including JavaScript tests.

### Ruby and Rails Quality

* **10 points** - Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and push business logic down where it belongs. There _zero_ instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility.

### JavaScript Style

* **8 points** - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


### Workflow

* **10 points** - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
