https://github.com/alirezaandersen/idea_box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/index.js#L101-L122
I think all of my JavaScript I am proud of. I did this project originally with mostly ajax and jquery calls but last night decided to try to do it in JavaScript. This particular section is the search, The reason I am most proud of it is I have never done a search filter like this and am proud that it works.

## Instructor Evaluation Points
​
### Specification Adherence
​
* **10 points**: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. There is no use of `format.js` in Rails. There is no use of unobstrusive JavaScript. There are no front-end frameworks used in the application. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
​
### User Interface
​
* **3 points** - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
​
### Testing
​
* **5 points** - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. Not all controller actions are tested. There are little or no attempts at integration testing.

### Ruby and Rails Quality
​
* **8 points** - Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### JavaScript Style
​
* **8 points** - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
​
### Workflow
​
* **10 points** - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
