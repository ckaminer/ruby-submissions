# Module 4 Cheatsheet

## Points

To graduate from Module 4 you will need to get ~80% of the total assigned points and pass your portfolio review. There will be ~1250 total points.

Everyone should have access to a google drive spreadsheet that lists where you're at in the point-wise.

If you don't have a link or the magic of google drive is on the fritz and your link isn't working, give us a shout.

## Doin' Homeworks Policy

[Assignment Submission Repo](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/tree/master/1511/module_4_assignments)

You'll find the directions to submit all assignments in the above repo (as they are assigned).

Projects are due on the day of the evaluation.

Smaller assignments/homeworks have a half life - meaning you can turn them in for full points up until EOD 7 days from when they were assigned. Otherwise, they'll be graded for half points.

We think you're all awesome adults, so we technically don't care if an assignment is 'late' - but in past modules we found that past due assignments ended up piling up and all getting turned in the last week - which was stressful for students... and meant that we didn't do a great job grading and giving feedback on them. So the sooner you turn in an assignment the better, but if you're at a job interview across the country/world, you have a few days wiggle room.

## Submission Forms

Mod 4 has a pull request based communicate system - so every major project this module is submitted using a submission form.

## The Portfolio

Portfolios, as with other modules, will be reviewed at the end of the year. Don't forget to get/give feedback throughout the module. And feel free to copy wholesale from your submission forms.

## Communicating with Instructors

Please, please, please, please, please feel comfortable tagging `@rrgayhart` in your pull requests on your projects. [Here's how it works](https://github.com/blog/821-mention-somebody-they-re-notified). It's a great way for us to do a 'pull request review' and answer your questions and give you technical feedback. Your mentors will (probably) love doing this too, and it's often easier for them to do than 1 on 1 pairing.

And finally, we know this might be your most hectic module at Turing, what with all that graduating and job hunting about to happen - if you have schedule conflicts on interviews, just let us know!
