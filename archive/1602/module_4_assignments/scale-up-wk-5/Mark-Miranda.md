### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.
I didn't know how much Ember was similar to rails. I also didn't know they are one of the only major js frameworks to not have been picked up, bought or owned by a major corporation (Angular - Google, React - Facebook)

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

It was an interesting experience. I feel like I have the most confidence in my abilities since I've been at Turing, but it's always a step back when your peers are looking at your code, let alone mentors and alums. It was great being able to work with people who have differing views and better ways to write code.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

It was a mixed bag, I liked doing them because it gave semi-real world introductions to what we'll hopefully be doing soon. The collaborative feel of stand-ups is also great too. I like being able to know that people are willing to help me, or point me in the right direction. The mixed bag part comes from majority of us being exhausted. Stand-ups often turned into sit-downs for some (not that I care semantically about what we were doing), and sometimes we just did nothing and had nothign to report. It was still great though.

### What features would you like to see the open source project you worked on have in the future?

Maybe exposure or a push towards frameworks/libraries in the weeks before? I feel like I couldve accomplished more in the project if we didn't spend a lot of time researching and trying to learn a new language

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

This was a great project! Thank you!

Instructor Evaluation:

## Notes

### Blog(s)

- Definitely include links to the repos and possibly screenshots in the blog post. Links to the original and current projects would be good.

- Really good background on the decisions behind the project, where other students were at when they created it, and what tech you chose.

- The ending to the blog is a little bit weak - since the rest of it is so strong. This would be a really great place to include links to the handoff documentation and the repos. That can back up your claim that you made significant progress without you having to write it all out.

### General

You and Josh did, seriously, a phenomenal job on this project. Not only did you get a ton done and tackled difficult technical challenges, what's more impressive to me is that you did so in a very thoughtful and well documented way. You left the project in a better shape than I would have if I were trying to put it together for students to pick it up. It shows a level of skill and professionalism that is really rare, especially among 'junior' developers but honestly, even in senior developers. 

## Score

150/150
### Blog Post (40 Points)  
  * 40: Developer has >= 2 blog posts documenting something they have worked on for their independent study or has one in depth blog post.


### Team Participation (40 points)

  * 40: Developer participated daily in stand ups with the group (remote or in person). Developer was able to speak to their work in stand ups in a way that was clear and informative. Developer was involved in pull request reviews.

### Hourly Work (30 points)

  * 30: Developer logged 7 to 8 hours per working day. Developer can speak to work completed during those hours.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (40 points)

  Instructor/Developer will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.

  * 40: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature or well documented spike. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
