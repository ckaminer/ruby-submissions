# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks

# Instructor Evaluation:

## Notes

### Blog(s)

This blog was really wonderful and I'm so glad that you wrote it! Some suggestions below:

Your disclaimer paragraph may not really be needed - particularly around your code challenge- you did a lot of upfront work on this project, so I think you can just say 'The goal of the project was to kick of an ongoing project' without diving into the details of taking the second week easy!

I like the shout out in `Meeka along with other people mentioned PivotalTracker, so this seemed like a great chance to check it out.` but if the blog is targeted at a larger audience, probably better to just refer to me as `my instructor` here.

When you shout out Julian and Lovisa, I'd recommend linking to their Github pages inline.

### General

I still think this is such a cool project idea and I'm really glad you chose to do it! I hope you keep at it after the finals and during your job hunt (which I suspect will not be a very long one).
