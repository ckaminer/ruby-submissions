# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks:
I set out to make a two player web-based game using socket.io, node and express. Though I didn't reach this goal, I did push my knowledge about these topics much futher, and was able to implement a local two-player game with some graphic enhancement, and to serve the game using node express.

### Hours logged this week?

- Tuesday (8 hours): 7
- Wednesday (8 hours): 6
- Thursday (8 hours): 4
- Friday (0 hours): 5 (including weekend)


### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.
I feel like the greatest benefit that this week has has provided me is a deeper understanding of what is going on in the projects that we've made in the past. Instead of moving forward as quickly as possible without full understanding of what I was implementing, I really took the time to find out what each module was doing and why. I think that I really expanded my toolset and ability to describe my work.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
I doubt that this opinion will be popular, but I actually enjoyed the PR reviews. The commentary that I received on my pull request was pretty targeted criticism or praise, and it seemed like a pretty helpful and congenial conversation from my point of view. It was a little different to be offering code up for complete strangers in addition to classmates, but I really liked how easily people could point out issues in my code, and I was able to quickly make changes because of how specific these criticisms were. I'm sure it gets more charged in the workplace, but I think PR review can be a great tool if people are really interested in constructive criticism.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
I really liked hearing about where my classmates were. I almost wish that we'd done these earlier in Turing, because I thought that it was a great way to discuss progress and share blockers with people. If I felt like I wasn't working on my 4th or 5th wind as we wrap up our time at Turing, I might have gotten more out of these.

# Instructor Evaluation:

## Notes

### Blog(s)

- Not required, but it would be a nice to have to link to things like npm when you define them in the post

- The blog post is _super good_ but ends pretty abruptly. Might be nice to add a wrap up paragraph that references/links to the repo and says that your next steps are to complete wiring up websockets - maybe discussing that you set up the framework of multiplayer play by starting by being able to do it locally. Or a wrap up paragraph that includes links to further research. Or both! Still a quality blog post though.

### General

Thanks for the feedback in this form! I agree that I wish we had some standups earlier in the program - actually, I really just wish I could run standups earlier in the program so I could get to know students before they're on their last winds. It's great being able to teach the class when they're fully formed developers and I don't have to be watching ya'll like a hawk - but I feel like it's hard to get to know the people who are protecting their burnout and pulled in a lot of directions.

## Score

150/150

### Blog Post (40 Points)  
  * 40: Developer has >= 2 blog posts documenting something they have worked on for their independent study or has one in depth blog post.

### Team Participation (40 points)

### Hourly Work (30 points)

  * 30: Developer logged 7 to 8 hours per working day. Developer can speak to work completed during those hours.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (40 points)

  Instructor/Developer will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.

  * 40: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature or well documented spike. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
