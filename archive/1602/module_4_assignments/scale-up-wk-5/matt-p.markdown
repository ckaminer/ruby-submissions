### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

  Loved the PR structure (althought it took a few days to adapt to) - I feel like it gave me an accurate impression of what day-to-day life will be like on the job.
  I appreciated my teammates and feel like I learned a lot about different ways of designing a rails apps by seeing other PRs.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand up

  Standups were great for accountability + seeing where the project was moving.

### Overview: 

  This was an excellent project to work on, it's an excellent 'slice of life' and I feel that I'm more personally invested in a quality outcome, given that the code I contribute will actively help real teachers/students.
  The team aspect also seperated this from other projects, there was higher accountability, and more variation in terms of tasks / challenges.
