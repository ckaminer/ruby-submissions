### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.

I really loved writing the blog because I learned a lot about React.js, primarily it's basic structure and how it works.

### Link to blog post(s)

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

PR Reviews have been good and also a growing experience. I love the feedback, however, with the amount of feedback it's hard to take it all in.  Often feedback is delayed and so I have to go back and fix things I already did.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

It's been good to hear that other people are in the same boat but the timing is hard some times.

# Instructor Evaluation:

Points: (max 150) 150

### Blog Post (40 Points)  
  * 40: Developer has >= 2 blog posts documenting something they have worked on for their independent study or has one in depth blog post.

*** Notes *** I enjoyed the blog post (glad to read you did too!) One suggestion, I'd recommend adding a section of resources people can check out once they've tried your tutorial out. Not critical, but a nice to have :D

### Team Participation (40 points)

  * 40: Developer participated daily in stand ups with the group (remote or in person). Developer was able to speak to their work in stand ups in a way that was clear and informative. Developer was involved in pull request reviews.

### Hourly Work (30 points)

  * 30: Developer logged 7 to 8 hours per working day. Developer can speak to work completed during those hours.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (40 points)

  Instructor/Developer will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.

  * 40: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature or well documented spike. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
 
*** Notes **** I don't know if this project felt like a risk to you - but I was definitely impressed by the fact that you could jump into something like this, working on something for a company and just getting stuff done. Good work.
