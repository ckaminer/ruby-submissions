# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks

I learned a lot about the way react-native works in terms of components, routing, styling, and making api calls, however I don't think that was the key takeaway from this assignment.
This project was riddled with really strange and complex issues. And in dealing with these issues I felt like I was learning a much more valuable skill. Navigating various issue pages, talking with other developers, and reaching out to people more than I ever have before really made this an enlightening experience. I really took for granted to the fact that rails, ruby, javascript, node just ...works. I didn't really think developers would create features in production that just wouldn't work. I felt like this was a true real world coding experience and it was fucking awesome!

The previous week I though I was going to work 8hrs on sat and sun but it turned out to be 4 so I wanted to include the previous weekend.


### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.
- How to efficiently go through project issues to find solutions
- How to use react-native-maps and all their features.

### Link to blog post(s)
- [React Native MapView Tutorial - IOS](https://medium.com/@gurusundesh/getting-started-with-react-native-mapview-5e0bd73aa602#.4h6av91vk)  
- [How to Make non HTTPS Requests in React Native](https://medium.com/@gurusundesh/how-to-make-non-https-requests-in-react-native-5e37ccc0166c#.u0jymw58g)

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
I commented here:  
https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingForFrontEnd/pull/67  
https://github.com/kristindiannefoss/snap_me_up/pull/1  
https://github.com/marinacor1/aggregate_yo/pull/13  
https://github.com/kamiboers/twobert/pull/1

I enjoyed jumping into other peoples code, seeing their coding style and thought processes and hopefully getting to add something meaningful. I didn't submit any pull requests so I made sure to be active on other peoples.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
It was really helpful to hear other peoples experiences during this project. I thought I was going to make a lot more progress than I did, and to hear the same story about new technology ups and downs from other people was really reassuring.

# Instructor Evaluation:

## Notes

### Blog(s)

##### React Native Tutorial

- YAY REACT NATIVE TUTORIAL!!!

- I might have missed it, but did you include a link to the tutorial repo that you made?

- The code screenshots that you included have some syntax highlighting from jshint that can be a little distracting. As you give more conference talks and write more blog posts (as I expect/hope you will because I think you'd be an awesome speaker) you'll find that the screen shots get really hard to work with when you need to make adjustments to code, and, heaven help us, if you switch your text editor color scheme. I'd recommend looking at embedding gists in medium - [Blog Post Here](https://medium.com/the-story/yes-we-get-the-gist-1c2a27cdfc22#.440u888uz) as a solution for this use case.


##### Non-HTTPS in React

- `it is recommended to not use non https request in your ios/android app` might be nice to include a link to why this isn't recommended.

- This is a great example of a short, to the point blog post that can solve someone's problem quickly :D

### General

Hot fire! Thanks for the image in the readme for the project (I think I have an emulator installed... probably... maybe... but that was helpful).. haha

Seriously though, you did a great job on this project and I think the takeaway that you mentioned in the summary is a. super valuable and b. something that you got as a result of how hard you worked and how much you stretched yourself. 

## Score

150/150

### Blog Post (40 Points)  
  * 40: Developer has >= 2 blog posts documenting something they have worked on for their independent study or has one in depth blog post.

### Team Participation (40 points)

  * 40: Developer participated daily in stand ups with the group (remote or in person). Developer was able to speak to their work in stand ups in a way that was clear and informative. Developer was involved in pull request reviews.

### Hourly Work (30 points)

  * 30: Developer logged 7 to 8 hours per working day. Developer can speak to work completed during those hours.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (40 points)

  Instructor/Developer will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.

  * 40: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature or well documented spike. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
