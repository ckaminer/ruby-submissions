### Summarize what you worked on the last two weeks

- Mainly just tried to work through the burn out, found that it's a lot harder than one might thing.
- In terms of the project, we did a lot of refactoring and added some minor features.

### Hours logged this week?

- Monday (0 hours):
- Tuesday (9 hours):
- Wednesday (8 hours):
- Thursday (8 hours):
- Friday (0 hours):

### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.

- What the heck React is.  I looked into Angular a little in between mod 3 and 4, and I just assumed they would be similar, but they're very different.

- React is component based, whereas Angular is more like a front end Rails.

### Link to blog post(s) submitted

- [gametime in java](https://medium.com/@jdliss/let-the-game-time-begin-c3cc6c2fe02c#.3nyf262zu)

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

- The whole PR system was pretty interesting.  There were some annoying things and some really good things.  I felt like some of the time people were leaving fairly pointless feedback just to be able to say that they participated.  Other times we got really in-depth and awesome feedback.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

- I liked standups, they're good for a bit of grounding.  You have to stop working and talk to people about what you did, and get to hear about what they're working on.  Sometimes I would be frustrated and subconsciously think that I was alone in that, and then I'd go to standup and hear someone else express they same things I was thinking.

- They're also good to remind yourself that you're a part of a bigger team than just your project team.  Coming together with the backend group and the MentorShip group was fun and a bit of a diversion (but still related to the project).

### What features would you like to see the open source project you worked on have in the future?

- Search by Company name

- Better location search

- Better styling

## Notes

### Blog(s)

`"No." I said. And that was that.`

- this is wonderful.

I really enjoyed this post. Funny, well written, and pertinant. 

I would recommend adding a link to the repo, maybe a screenshot of the game, and calling out and linking to your mentor by name and his comments - since I think those are very impressive.

### General

Thanks for your feedback throughout the project and the burn out honesty. I assume you already know this, but be careful in real projects/jobs when you get burned out to keep it a little bit more under wraps in group scenarios. I think you have a very thoughtful way of assessing situations and are a super hardworker - but, while hilarious, the 'what she said' response to stand up doesn't convey how much is going on in the background. We all know one another, are in the same boat and know this about you - so it's a'ok at Turing... but in a job, not everyone will have that background context. 

Again, I think you already know this, but I am contractually obligated as an instructor to point it out. :D

Thank you for the hard work on this project and over this project and fighting that burn out!
