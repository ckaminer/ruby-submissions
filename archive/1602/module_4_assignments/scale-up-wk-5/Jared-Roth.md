# Scale Up Submission Form - Open Source Projects

## Basics

### Link(s) to the PRs or Issues You Picked Up
I created this one to cover some of the research work I had done and to have something for future students to reference and instructors to build upon.

### Summarize what you worked on the last two weeks

  These Last two weeks, I worked on the LookingFor back end on an assortment of unrelated small issues. First, I created an endpoint that front end had requested for viewing all job postings for a particular company. Next, I bashed my head against implementing an exceptionally simple gem that I unknowingly had working the day before. I then cleaned up the README a little to help future collaborators get on their feet and did some exploratory work into potential future analysis endpoints.

### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.

I didn't realize how errors were handled in Rails. (Which is a large part of the reason I didn't know how to set up the error reporting.) For the most part, this is basically the topic of my blog.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

The mentors were extremely helpful in picking out things we never would have thought of at this point in our education/career. I found the feedback educational regarding the code itself, but also in other ways. It definitely reinforced the idea that there are multiple (correct) ways to do things and that everyone has differing opinions. The entire process also helped give a glimpse into professional life.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

Other than the feeling that I had never quite accomplished enough, they were a positive experience. It was a relaxed environment for both sharing progress and setting expectations. Being a daily occurrence, it was also great for knowing when others needed anything from me as well as being able to help with their blockers.

### What features would you like to see the open source project you worked on have in the future?

Many more features related to searching, sorting, and analyzing data.

## Notes

### Blog(s)

##### Joining and Existing Project

I think I'm going to add this blog post to the pre-work readings to be done if people accept this project. It's a good perspective.

##### Error Reporting

Don't feel 'stupid'! We should talk most about API status codes as instructors!

I'd recommend including a link to the place in the repo where you added the code. Potentially a screenshot of the slack channel in motion.

### General

Thanks for adding some more deets to the research spike issue - and for being open to researching that as a final move on the project. The rails wasn't the most glorious of places to be working during this section of LookingFor - since the front end was refactoring and therefor didn't have as many urgent needs - but setting up the errors channel is _super_ helpful for me personally. So all glory to the errors channel.
