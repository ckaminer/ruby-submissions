### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.
  I learned how to integrate youtube videos via iframe in an app. It will allow my client to independently add/edit/delete videos about his work. Connected to that I learned how to use youtube for uploading and editing videos. So fun and exciting to get this figured out all by myself!!!

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
  I felt a little insecure at first putting my work out there and putting my opinions about other's code out there. But both was a great experience. Feedback I got made me look for a better solution which made the quality of my code better. Reviewing other's code taught me new things of how one can do things.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
  I really enjoyed this workflow of daily check ins and working on our own during the rest of the day. The checkins also allowed for input from and to others in the group which was enriching and useful. I wish to get a job in an environment that supports this workflow.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
  Scale up has been one of my favorite projects at Turing. It has given me a chance to combine all the different aspects I have learned at Turing in a perfect playground without the usual incredibly high stress level. I finally had time to research and figure things out all by myself which helps a lot with my confidence. This project feels like a taste of what work life could be which makes me so excited about starting a job soon. This TexArch app will probably be my playground for a long time. I just love trying things out this way.

- I would recommend linking to the site/github for the site early on in your blog post. 

- When you explain the Sign In With Google - you could include actual screenshots of the login process.

- 'Arbitrary and Magical' - hehehe

### General

Claudia, you _killed it_ this week. Seriously. Great work on the project, lots of things got done and you used the resources (mentors, pr review, standups) incredibly well. I am very much looking forward to seeing your career in tech as it grows.
