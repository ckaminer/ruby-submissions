### Summarize what you worked on the last two weeks
I worked on each of the large commits that were incorporated into the project these past two weeks: enter to submit a search, splitting up the Job component, splitting up the SearchBarAndListings component, and editing the server file to render jobs on new tabs. Although Jeneve ultimately made the breakthrough on the last of those, I feel that (and hope that) the research I did in prior to that helped us get there. This was very much a group project and everyone contributed, but I would say that 'everyone' in this case includes me and that I had my hands in most of the big pieces that got merged.

### Hours logged this week?

- Tuesday (6.75 hours): Classwork, standup, programming.
- Wednesday (6.0 hours): Programming, PR review, study.
- Thursday (4.5 hours): Standup, programming, classwork.
- Sunday (7 hours): Blogpost and final submission work.

### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.
I knew very little about React. I learned a great deal from the Creact tutorial, the two lessons we had, and then digging into the code itself. It was interesting working in an existing codebase with a new technology. I'm at a point where it feels like I should be able to pick up on what's going on in a file, even if I'm not altogether comfortable with the language/framework. That was the case with React. It felt very comfortable, but I'm sure part of that had to do with the fact that I wasn't having to create anything from scratch. I almost always had a code snippet that I could use as an example of something that had worked before. The web often offers the same sorts of things, but having it within the project that you're working gives you an additional layer of comfort simply because you know that there's not some dependency hiding somewhere uninstalled.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
My experience getting PR feedback is more fully covered in the first blogpost linked above, but generally it was a positive experience. As I mention in my post, I was surprised how often reacting to a comment came down to saying that we weren't going to incorporate the comment in the code we were committing, but did plan on addressing at a later point.

Doing PR reviews was an interesting experience. I'm not altogether happy with the way that I did mine, which was generally to just dig into the code changed instead of the larger project. Not having that level of familiarity limits how constructive your comments can be.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
Daily stand ups were great, though I found myself to sometimes be a little on the serious side? Kind of strictly business, when maybe I could've lightened up a little bit. An odd thing to notice, I'm sure, but it feels important to remember that we're working with people as well as code, and sometimes it can be nice to just... be a person? Other than that, I really enjoyed them.

### What features would you like to see the open source project you worked on have in the future?
I'd like for the next group to take a look at the fix we implemented for opening things in new windows. It works, but the urls aren't any kind of pretty. I feel like there's a better solution, but we felt that the functionality outweighed the vanity urls.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
I really liked this project. I really liked the feeling of working with my team, but communicating with the larger structure. I have a consulting background, and it felt about as authentic as one could expect in a classroom setting. It really feels like a nice project to transition out into the rest of the world.

## Notes

### Blog(s)

##### Commits and the People Who Love Them

- Having given the assignment - this blog post was super intersting to read. Excellent way of presenting the comments/code being commented (inline and also with links)

- The paragraph discussing the types of responses (Directly Related, etc) could benefit from being visually broken up a little bit - either with line breaks or some judicious bolding.

- Minor spelling error: I definitely felt responsible for making sure their requests didn't go `unannswered`.

##### Up to Speed With React

- Would suggest linking the repo early on in the post

- I'd really like to actually link this blog post in the README of the front end repo - I think it would be super helpful to the next batch of students


### General

Thanks for the work you did on this project and for taking on (being assigned because obviously) the role of project lead. Most teams tend to push towards adding features rather than spending time to refactor and leave the code base in a better place - so it takes good leadership to get a team to both move in that direction and to also find that work interesting and fulfilling. Not that I am telling you anything you don't already know - but it's very appreciated!

Interesting perspective on the Project Stand Ups and being on the serious side. I think the stand up during Scale Up is kind of a combination of actual project/company stand up and also a little bit of a release vent. From a human perspective, I think having someone at a stand up who is confident in the work they have accomplished, and what they're doing next and presents it professionally and all business is actually just as heart warming (if not more) than someone who is joking around. You never came off as being overly serious or not personable (I suspect this would be difficult for you to accidentally do ever). Sometimes being the prepared/reasonable one in the meeting actually allows other people to feel more comfortable, and more open. I wouldn't change a thing (unless you felt disconnected from the group).
