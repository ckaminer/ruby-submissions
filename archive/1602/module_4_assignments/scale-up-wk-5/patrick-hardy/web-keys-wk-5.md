# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks
I built a MIDI Controller, Synthesizer and Oscilloscope in JavaScript. I learned a lot about the Web-MIDI-API, Web-Audio-API, oscillators, D3 and React.

### Link(s) to Your Work

 [Repo](https://github.com/patrickwhardy/web-keys)
 - Production (if relevant)

### Hours logged this week?

- Tuesday (8 hours):6
- Wednesday (8 hours):6

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.
Although it didn't result in deliverable code, I was happy to go through setting up React again as well as learning a fair bit about D3. I was really excited to build an oscilloscope tonight!

### Link to blog post(s)
[Blog](https://medium.com/@patrickwhardy/theres-a-synthesizer-in-your-browser-5070a42681c7#.xtwl3l8y1)

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
I read through a lot of Looking for Front End and commented on John Liss' most recent PR.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
I was happy to participate in every standup. It was cool that, despite struggling to learn new material on their own, most people's projects ended up with a deliverable product this week.


### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
I plan to make a sample video for the blog and repo as well host this somewhere.

# Instructor Evaluation:

## Notes

### Blog(s)

- Don't forget to link to your repo early on in the blog

- You should visually distinguish the code in your blog post in some way. In markdown you can use backticks (`one line`) - multiple lines can be wrapped in three repeating backticks


### General

I would strongly recommend beefing up the README of your project - check this out for [tips and tricks](https://gist.github.com/rrgayhart/91bba7bb39ea60136e5c). I'm excited to see the recorded demo that you mentioned - since I don't have a midi keyboard to test things out.

This is so cool. Btw.
