# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks

- I took the first week to learn about Docker and how to set up a development environment for a rails project.
- I then took some time to study Linux.
- Finally I spent time poking around with Vagrant.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.
I took a look at Vagrant's source code this week with the intention of finding an issue that I could try to resolve.  Holy s#!t. I really like the thought of contributing to open source projects, but haven't yet.  Hopefully I'll find some interesting projects with issues that I can attempt to tackle. Needless to say I didn't get anything done on Vagrant.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
I did one PR for my docker environment and replied to a few during the project.  I got pretty good feedback, about my PR, though it was pretty straightforward.

I had varying success offering what I thought was useful advice to my peers on their projects.  I think a lot of that is because most of the projects showing up in the PR Rodeo were JS/front-end stuff.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
Stand ups were good.  I think it made me keep a slightly better thought process about what I had been doing and what I planned to do since I had to verbalize it to other people every day.  It also helped me think about certain aspects of my project since I was using some technologies that other people didn't necessarily understand, so thinking of a way to discuss those was occasionally tricky.

# Instructor Evaluation:

## Notes

### My Week with Docker

`It was very simple to configure and created a container for the app and another to run the Postgre DB. (Iâ€™ll link some tutorials at the bottom.)
`

- Misspelling of db and tutorials not linked

- I would recommend linking to the docker config file on github that you created

### Docker v Vagrant

- If the visuals in the blog post came from somewhere else, make sure to attribute them with a link in the image tag or below

- I like the addition of the link to the stack overflow question that has been answered by both authors - I would recommend inlining the link and also saying who the authors are (names and their usernames on StackOverflow)

### General

Thanks for being very involved in stand ups and being patient with Mod 4, even if it isn't your favorite topic :D. Since your main takeaway on this project was education, I'd recommend making the above changes to the blogs and beefing them up with links to the resources that you used to study up on these topics (and short descriptions). It's an easy win that would make them more interesting without forcing you to write a ton of new content.

## Score

Points: 130

### Blog Post (40 Points)  
  * 40: Developer has >= 2 blog posts documenting something they have worked on for their independent study or has one in depth blog post.

### Team Participation (40 points)

  * 40: Developer participated daily in stand ups with the group (remote or in person). Developer was able to speak to their work in stand ups in a way that was clear and informative. Developer was involved in pull request reviews.

### Hourly Work (30 points)

  * 30: Developer logged 7 to 8 hours per working day. Developer can speak to work completed during those hours.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (40 points)

  Instructor/Developer will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.

  * 20: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by an almost delivered feature whose next steps are not well documented.
