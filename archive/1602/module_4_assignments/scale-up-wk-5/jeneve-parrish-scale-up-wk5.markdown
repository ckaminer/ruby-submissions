### Summary of what I worked on the last two weeks

I did a lot of research into animating with CSS, using the Sketch design app and SVG. I paired with my team to
refactor the code in the project and fix some major bugs, and in so doing learned a lot about the structure and workings
React components. I think we did work that will enormously help the next teams make real progress in adding new features and improving User Experience. I spent an inordinate amount of time debugging npm package version stuff on my machine.

### Something I didn't know before the prework...

How to structure a React App. I know know about state and props and how to use them. I know about Hash History and how the browser knows about state in a client-side application. I know the fundamentals of CSS animation.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

It's pretty neat to get feedback from outside the project, much of what we heard from mentors was great feedback and often
led to the creation of new issues on the project.

It was always interesting to look at bits of code from Whiskey Tango projects in particular, and I was surprised that there was usually a little something that I could chime in on.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

Feels awkward, but maybe this is by design, to keep them short and on topic. I did like hearing about what the back-end team was doing.

### What features would you like to see the open source project you worked on have in the future?

The back-end team created a new end-point for showing all past jobs per company, we didn't get around to using it, but that would be a great feature. Generally I'd love to see some wire-framing for the site so that design-oriented participants can push the look and feel of the site with agreed-upon intention.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I wish there was more time for this...oh --- wait --- no, I don't --- I wish I had a job like this.

## Notes

### Blog(s)

- This blog is amazing. Will you come write content for the front end course with us?

- No, seriously, this tutorial is excellent.

- The formatting of the blog post makes it unreadable in a mobile format - I'm guessing because of the tables? LMK if you want any help making it more responsive (either I or Louisa or Allison can try and halp!)

- Minor spelling error: SVGs are smaller file size compared to other `statndard` image formats


### General

I am not surprised by this, but you did a wonderful job documenting and leaving things for the next class to work from and towards. 

I think you're right that the work done this module will elevate the project experience for the next group. I am also very glad that you pointed out and flagged the fact that we need wireframes to work from so that design oriented people on the project can move forward easier (and so that non-design oriented people can also move forward easier, without adding, I don't know, various shades of neon green).

It was great to hear the story of you working with your brother to do some npm debugging (even though the fact that you had to do so much debugging is a bummer).

## Score

150/150

### Blog Post (40 Points)  
  * 40: Developer has >= 2 blog posts documenting something they have worked on for their independent study or has one in depth blog post.

### Team Participation (40 points)

  * 40: Developer participated daily in stand ups with the group (remote or in person). Developer was able to speak to their work in stand ups in a way that was clear and informative. Developer was involved in pull request reviews.

### Hourly Work (30 points)

  * 30: Developer logged 7 to 8 hours per working day. Developer can speak to work completed during those hours.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (40 points)

  Instructor/Developer will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.

  * 40: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature or well documented spike. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
