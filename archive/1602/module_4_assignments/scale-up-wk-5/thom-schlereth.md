# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks

  I've worked on WebGL for the last few weeks. I learned an overview of what WebGL is, and how it works. Figure out the different functions to create a 3D object and how to render them. Part of the focus was on all the new terminology and part of it was how does it work. Playing with Shaders and lighting and learning some math.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.

  I had no idea linear algebra was a thing. Luckily it seems super intemidating, but when you get into it it's not so bad.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
  
 - It felt very detached this time around. When Ashwin and I worked on gametime we took our PR reviews seriously. We spent a lot of energy on it and wrote back and forth. It was great. On this project I was kind of working on my own, and didn't know what everyone else was doing. When I tried jumping in to there project, I had to give very basic pr reviews on high level stuff because I didn't really know what they were working on. I like having the time to explore, but this was a large drawback.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

- I loved the standups on the other hand. It kept me somewhat in the loop and connected. It was fun to hear what everyone else was working on. Also it was nice to hear everyone was struggling with the projects they picked and that I wasn't the only one.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below! 

- There was some blowback about how this scale up project went. That we should have had more classes and direction, but I disagree. It wasn't comfortable, but it was rewarding to go out on a limb and try new things. I think it's a great skill to work on before we're released into the wild.

## Notes

### Blog(s)

- `WebGL kind of sucks to learn at first though. The tutorials you'll find are mostly subpar, with few exceptions.` Since this blog post is about WebGL, the odds of someone else who wrote a blog post or tutorial about it reading this post are pretty high. With that in mind, I'd make this statement a little more PC as it currently reads a little judgemental. Maybe something like `I found WebGL difficult to teach to myself through tutorials.`

- I dig the use of `Bing` over `Google` here.. haha

I really like the direction you took on the blog post

If you're looking for a 'networking' opportunity - may I suggest finding some WebGL developers - sending them the blog and telling them that you would like some suggestions on more advanced resources since you blog covers the beginner's track. I don't think the blog technically needs it, but it's a low hassle request that could get you in contact with WebGL devs.


### General

This last commit should proooooobably not stay the last commit in your public repo https://github.com/thompickett/webGl/commit/70263e1351542dba3861350fd5cd937e0c3e6bc8 - just because the first thing someone would see would be the words `shit` and then `spike` and those two together are not something you want associated with your personal brand - from, like, a human imagination standpoint!

Seriously though, even though it's a playground, I would recommend adding a readme that links to your blogpost and just states that this is a playground (you could just take the summary from this submission form).

I think given the other obligations going on - it's reasonable to feel detached from the PR process. I think you and Kris were in the same boat where a. it was important to you that the work you do be exploratory (so requesting PR reviews feels silly and counterproductive, because the code isn't meant to be 'merged to master' and b. it was important to you to explore independently

I'd never really thought about that perspective before - it's probably a really good thing to talk about at the beginning of scale up.

Thank you for the feedback on your thoughts around the blowback. There's always going to be blowback, but I'm really glad the project worked for you in most ways. Good work on this even and especially during the entire process of getting married :D
