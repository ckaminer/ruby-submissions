# Scale Up Submission Form - Open Source Projects

## Basics

### Link(s) to the PRs or Issues You Picked Up

* [GitHub OAuth in Rails](https://github.com/turingMentorSHIP/MentorSHIP-API/pull/4)
* [Documentation for future buccaneers](https://github.com/turingMentorSHIP/mentorSHIP-documentation)

### Summarize what you worked on the last two weeks

Pushing through burn out and accepting, and learning from failure. I spent more time reading than actually programming. I learned a ton about Authentication and Authorization, Ember.js and working with front end applications in general.

### Hours logged this week?

- Monday (0 hours): 0
- Tuesday (8 hours): 7:00
- Wednesday (8 hours): 7:11
- Thursday (8 hours): 3:00
- Friday (0 hours): 4:00
- Saturday: untracked time writing blog post and documentation

### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.

Even though Ember has a lot of similarities to Rails, it's also very different.

### Link to blog post(s) submitted

My original idea for a blogpost about authentication was scrapped, because we ultimately didn't finish the system we had envisioned.

A lot of the thoughts I had regarding that were instead put into [the MentorSHIP documentation](https://github.com/turingMentorSHIP/mentorSHIP-documentation) for the next group of students who choose to hoist the sails.

After writing that documentation, and due to some of the issues I encountered reviewing PRs, I wrote a blog post about documentation.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

I only had 1 PR each week and didn't get a lot of meaningful feedback on either one. But I enjoyed the process of reviewing other peoples. Most of my PR reviews can be summed up by this image:
###### Replace cloud with lack of readme

I did spend about an hour trying to debug Kris having an issue with the asset pipeline.
* [PR](https://github.com/kristindiannefoss/snap_me_up/pull/3)

And a couple hours debugging Claudia's controller test errors
* [PR](https://github.com/Claudia108/TexArch/pull/62)

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

I enjoyed standup, it was fun to get an idea what everyone was working on, even if I usually felt pretty lazy in comparison with what I accomplished.
I did miss standup on Tuesday, as I decided to stay home in the morning to work and go in after lunch, but ended up falling asleep at my desk around noon.

### What features would you like to see the open source project you worked on have in the future?

A functioning prototype, that's well documented. I'd like to keep involved with this and keep a close eye on the next group of students to take up the project.

## Notes

### Blog(s)

- if you want contributors or just someone to look over your code when `your` stuck. . If `your` proud of your style chops though, this is the place to show it. --- `you're`

- The blog post is very good, and makes a great argument for why to document and exactly how. I appreciate it, perhaps because I have spent the last 3/4 years being an old man yelling at READMEs.

### General

You and Mark really did a phenomenal job on this project. I left some effusive notes in his review as well - but to summarize, between the handoff documentation, balancing technology choices against the needs of the future students in a way to work towards the project not ever getting scrapped, and the sheer amount of working, deployed code... this was professional level work that is above what is expected of Junior programmer and often above what mid and senior level developers do. 

You are 100% welcome to continue working on this project after you graduate. And don't underestimate how much work you accomplished - even if it felt like clawing your way uphill against burnout and authentication. 

## Score
