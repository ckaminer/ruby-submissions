### Points for Second Check In (base 50)
60/50

### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In
  
  - The time between now and when it's due should be spent polishing the application, adding tests, and looking at managing code quality(methods being refactored)
  - look into partial functions, currying, and even closures 
  - build out landing page for game 
  - game page should explain how to play the game and it should have some styling.
  - deployed to github pages.


### Feedback?
  - great job reaching all of your goals 
  - loved the drops. 
  - if you have time look into the wing man and getting the drop to be bigger.
