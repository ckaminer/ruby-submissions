# Game Time Check In # 2

## Instructor Goal Completion

### GOAL 1
[Collision detection on bullets](https://github.com/Salvi6God/raiden_fighter/blob/6380b42ee3cf3b23bafa5b1335527e16f5e00399/lib/index.js#L83-L98)

Comments:
Went well, but it is a good base to improve on.


### GOAL 2
[Enemy plane movement and shooting ability](https://github.com/Salvi6God/raiden_fighter/blob/6380b42ee3cf3b23bafa5b1335527e16f5e00399/lib/enemyPlane.js#L14-L34)

Comments:
Went well, but we need to figure out how to make the enemy plane movement more complex.


### GOAL 3

[Collision detection with enemies/enemy bullets and user](https://github.com/Salvi6God/raiden_fighter/blob/6380b42ee3cf3b23bafa5b1335527e16f5e00399/lib/index.js#L83-L98)

Comments:
This one is pretty solid but we still need to refactor a bit of the code.


## Next Steps?
Break our code out into other files, testing, better movement for the enemy, and better missile patterns.


### General Questions, Comments, Concerns?
We are having trouble breaking stuff into other files during our refactoring process in this project.

## Instructor Section

### Points for Second Check In (base 50)

50/50

### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In

- Finish refactor and test existing code
- Multiple enemies
  - Have all enemies respond to being hit
  - Render enemies with sprites (?)
  - Enemies come towards the ship - either planes move or the background moves

- Decision on top down with levels vs increasing difficulty without rounds
  - First pass on increasing difficulty in the code

- Keep track of score

Extra Credit

- Form of upgrade - buy upgrade between levels or collect coins
- Different enemy styles - different bullet styles
- Boss enemy - big ship - has health and can't be killed immediately
