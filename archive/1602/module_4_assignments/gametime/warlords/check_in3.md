# Game Time Check In # 3

## Instructor Goal Completion

### Drew's Goals

- [aws elasticbeanstalk](http://warlordsnode-env.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/)
- [heroku](http://still-tundra-75849.herokuapp.com/?)
- [github (node server)](https://github.com/drew-t/node-gametime/tree/master)
- [github (webpack w/ sockets)](https://github.com/drew-t/gametime/tree/paddle-sockets)

- Get sockets going with relevant information so that we can start using them for the actual project.
  - They are working, but not yet integrated with the game (in a separate repo).
  - Client side needs testing.

### Jared's Goals
- [Add walls/flag(player)](https://github.com/drew-t/gametime/blob/win-condition/lib/player.js)
- [Refactor long methods in ball class](https://github.com/drew-t/gametime/blob/win-condition/lib/ball.js)

Concerns:
 - Refactored old things but new things are... messy.
 - [Testing certain things](https://github.com/drew-t/gametime/blob/6bb3b9af30fe1ac7c2f8d39fa6def52f29bf6e94/lib/ball.js#L43-L59)


### Josh's Goals
- [Integrate ball and paddles](https://github.com/drew-t/gametime/blob/6bb3b9af30fe1ac7c2f8d39fa6def52f29bf6e94/lib/ball.js#L125-L136)
- [Refactor long methods in paddle class]((https://github.com/drew-t/gametime/blob/win-condition/lib/paddle.js))

## Next Steps?
