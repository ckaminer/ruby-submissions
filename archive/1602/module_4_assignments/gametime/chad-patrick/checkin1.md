## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

###MVP
- Spaceship accelerates in the direction it's aimed
- Spaceship shoots from the front; arrow keys dictate direction of ship
- Bullets only travel 50 % of the canvas width
- When an asteroid is hit, it splits into smaller asteroids or is destroyed
- Upon collision of asteroid, player looses a life
- When objects travel off of the canvas they reappear on the opposite side with the same velocity
- Increased difficulty is a greater rate of asteroid appearance
- Game is over when player has lost all their lives, high score is based on time

### Single Player Extensions
- Asteroids have three sizes. When the smallest size is hit, it disintegrates
- Add enemy ships that shoot back - can be shot/destroyed
- Player looses a life when shot
- Player can pick up various weapons
  - e.g. shotgun effect, speed boost, rapid fire, laser

### Multiplay Extensions
- Multiplayer option (sockets)
- Two players are on the same canvas and they can shoot/destroy each other
  - asteroids would still be present, you just can also get killed by your opponent
