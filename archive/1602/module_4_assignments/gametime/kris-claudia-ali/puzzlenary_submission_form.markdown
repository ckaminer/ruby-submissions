## Completion

### Do You Consider the Application to be Fully Playable?
 - If not, list what functionality is missing.
 Absolutely!  Plus it's adorable.  

### What Extensions, as Requested By an Instructor, Did You Complete?
- Per Extension:
  - Describe the extension
  Kris wanted to animate the lives lost, which we were able to do.  As the lives are lost the ponies on the scoreboard go away and are reset every level.  

  - Provide a .gif of the extension or a link to the relevant code
  [Loose Pony Lives Gif](http://g.recordit.co/bTrufFUUaw.gif)

  We have a lot of very thorough testing, so we met that goal.  New pictures are used for each level, and bad colors increase every level so we met all of our goals.  

### What Features, if Any, Do You Feel Exceed Instructor Expectations?
- Per Feature:
 - Describe the feature
 - Provide a .gif of the feature in action or a link to the relevant code

 Our game is fun and interesting to play.  The production value is very good and it is something we all will be proud to show.

## Risk Taking
- What risks did you feel you took on this project?
- How do you feel about those risks?

We took on the task of creating a game that we hadn't necessarily played before so there was a lot of discussion on what it would do and how.  In the end I think we are all happy with what we made but it might have been easier to make something we didn't have to spend mental energy to define.

## Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
- Why were you proud of this piece of code?
[Kris Modals](https://github.com/Claudia108/puzzlenary/blob/master/lib/modals.js)
I was able to write this file and break the modals down into their own functions to export.  I'm just really excited about the modal functionality on the static site and the pony life animation, and what we were able to do, this is when JS got fun for me, so this is a highlight.  


[Ali](https://github.com/Claudia108/puzzlenary/blob/master/lib/levels.js)
The implementation of levels that had to be integrated to the game.js file based on multiple functionality. It also allows the player to be able to restart the level or start a new game.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
- Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

### Test Breakdown
- How Many Unit Tests?
- How Many Feature/Integration Tests?


23 unit tests - some of the cover more than one specific function. 3 tests include click events (“game start” and “game end) but are not full feature tests.


### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a unit test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'

### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a feature test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'

Functional Expectations

35 points - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expecations set by instructors


User Interface

15 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.


Testing

30 points - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite convers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.

JavaScript Style

25 points - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


Workflow

25 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
on control.

Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

15 points - Zero complaints

## Instructor Feedback
- great use of closures in the modal file 
- some refactoring in the game file could happen. 
- loved the use of classes/constructors 
- great job

- Points: 300/(base 300)
