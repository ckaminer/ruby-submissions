### Game Name

ClickyTrollaPootzleh aka Puzzlenary, boooooooooo


### Give a Basic Description of the Game

Uncover a picture by clicking shapes on a canvas.

User opens game page, sees an blank canvas, clicks "start", some animation begins, shapes on the grid flash random colors on the grid. Game starts. When a specific color appears, user should click to reveal that section of the picture.
User should not click the shapes in another specified color. More colors are added to the list of "do not click" as the levels progress. Game is won when the picture is uncovered. Game is lost if a block of the wrong color is clicked on three times.

## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

- Higher levels divide the canvas more and add more "good" or "distracting" colors are added for complexity.

- Picture gets uncovered.

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

- Black canvas with only two flashing colors you have to click one and not the other, until all are uncovered.

- The grid division increases difficulty level.

### What have you accomplished so far?

- Initial setup for file structure
- First attempt of canvas
- Passing test
