	- comment: this was hard. we did it.

### Adding tests

- [bird test](https://github.com/jeneve/typrr-burn/blob/master/test/bird-test.js)
- [level test](https://github.com/jeneve/typrr-burn/blob/master/test/level-test.js)
- [keystroke test](https://github.com/jeneve/typrr-burn/blob/master/test/keystroke-test.js)

- We still need to get bird tests passing, but we know how to do that now.
- We need to get a test we wrote earlier to pass whether we are using production or development tests

- We still want to animate the bird. We think we know how to do that. There is a lot of image editing to do before we can try.

### General UX/design

- We are happy, want to add more color. We want to add a header with the name of the game and a footer with links to our githubs

## Next Steps?

- fix bugs in keystroke scoring

then....

- tackle the extras...
- a countdown
- bird flies in and out at level and game end/start
- refactoring
