# Game Time Check In # 2

## Instructor Goal Completion

### Bird falls slowly

#### ![screen recording](http://g.recordit.co/TzUXZaA7bP.gif)
#### Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
_no, the bird falls by default, if the player types correctly the bird rises, if the player types incorrectly, the bird falls more_
#### Questions, Comments, Concerns?
_We want the bird to be an animation of a flapping bird, and the background to be scrolling to give the illusion of movement...next steps?_

##### Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.

_there are about 6 sentences to type for each level, after typing them all, the player is prompted to start the next level. There are 6 levels that increase in difficulty by length, types of character and complexity_
#### Questions, Comments, Concerns?

_there is a bug at the end of the last level, my button to play again won't appear. (but actually we'd like to use key commands for this too) We still need to save high scores_
