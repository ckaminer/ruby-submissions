Notes:
* Spec harness passes, in 1 minute, 18 seconds.
* Only Iteration 4.
* 137 examples finished in 1 minute and 39.3 seconds.
* There are opportunities to refactor out unnecessary variable assignment
with new methods.
* Very interesting approach to repo and item creation, really like how
thats broken out.
* Some math stuff would like to have seen in its own object, be it a class
or a module or something.

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

### 6. Code Sanitation

The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...

* 4: Zero complaints
