## Evaluation Rubric

Team: Jonathan Liss & Christopher Soden & Hedy Woo
Evaluator: Rachel

Notes:

* all iterations are complete; data in iteration 8 is not scoped per client
* client methods tested for muliple clients sometimes, but not consistent
* feature tests looked good -- good use of scoping to specific HTML elements
* good use of ActiveRecord for queries
* views looked good -- no logic leaking through 
* inclusion of module in server file is somewhat confusing - sets instance variables without being clear
* some methods in Client Parser module should be built in Event, Url, and Client classes

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

#### 6. View Layer

* 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

While you won't be graded on workflow for Rush Hour, here's an example of how you will be evaluated on workflow later in the module:

#### Workflow (NOT GRADED)

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.
* 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.
* 2: Sporadic use of branches, pull requests, and/or project-management tool.
* 1: Little use of branches, pull requests, and/or a project-management tool.

Team: Marina Corona & Patrick Hardy & Ashwin Rao
Evaluator: Rachel

Notes:

* all base functionality implemented correctly
* use the built-in relationship for payload_requests instead of PayloadRequest.where(client_id: self.id)
* views are good for the most part -- check _hours.erb for variable assignment
* server file very clean. gave suggestion to send one instance variable that methods can be called on instead of multiple

Team: Sal Espinosa & Jeneve Parrish & Gurusundesh Khalsa & Alireza Andersen
Evaluator: Rachel

Notes:

* all base functionality exists; iteration 8 needs to be scoped to the client
* use of "builder" objects for data presentation
* good use of Active Record for querying
* very clean views

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3.5

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 4: Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic.

#### 6. View Layer
