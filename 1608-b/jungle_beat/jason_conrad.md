## Assessed By: Mike

## Notes: 
* Completed I2, started work on I3
* code uses iterative approach
* Would like to have seen tests check for more edge cases,
* There is some redundancy in tests, and they dont really test the full functionality of I2.
* Some confusion about attr_ shortcuts.

## Scores:


## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient


### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring


### 5. Looping *or* Recursion


* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
