## Assessed By: Jeff

## Notes:

* 14 tests all pass
* Try to write some tests for edge cases -- generally 2+ tests per method
* Tests themselves are well written and organized
* Implementation is clean and good
* Look for opportunities to "name" a chunk of code by extracting it to a method

## Scores:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
