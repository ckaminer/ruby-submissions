## Assessed By: Beth Sebian

## Notes:
* Repo here: https://github.com/dshinzie/date_night
* Recursion used everywhere needed
* Some long methods and nested if/else statement should be refactored
* Testing was greatest area of weakness. Some tests missed actually testing functionality
* Missing `health` method

## Scores:

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations
* 2: Application is missing one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion
* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
