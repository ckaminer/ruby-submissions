## Assessed By: Beth Sebian

## Notes:
* Repo here: https://github.com/bradgreen3/binary_search_tree
* Strong implementation of basic features, with some gaps still causing crashes
* Ruby style and syntax shows understanding of principles
* Insert still under development (hence 1 in functionality): adds nodes, doesn't return depth
* Lots of good learning behind existing functionality
* LOVE that the node is handling creation of links

## Scores:

## Evaluation Rubric
The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations
* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion
* 2: Application has issues with loop/recursion techniques or mixes them inappropriately
