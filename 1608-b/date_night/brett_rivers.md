## Assessed By: Beth Sebian

## Notes:
* Repo here: https://github.com/riverswb/date_night
* Missing `load` and `health` base methods
* Testing sufficient, would like to see more unit and edge-case tests
* `Insert` implemented using recursion, while `sort`, `min`, `max` implemented with hash holding data
* Overall strong start: in spite of completion shortcomings, the project demonstrates some comfort with Ruby principles and tactics. 

## Scores:

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations
* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion
* 2: Application has issues with loop/recursion techniques or mixes them inappropriately
