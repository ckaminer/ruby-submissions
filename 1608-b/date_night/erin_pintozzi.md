## Assessed By: Beth Sebian

## Notes:
* Repo here: https://github.com/epintozzi/date_night
* Missing sort method
* Some missing coverage, very strong in other areas (covering edge cases and verifying impact of methods like `load`)
* TONS of nested if/elsif statements. Would like to see these reorganized
* Solid use of recursion. Nice job!

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations
* 2: Application is missing one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion 
* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
