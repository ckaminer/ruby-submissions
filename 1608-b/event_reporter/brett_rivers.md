Repo:

Notes:

* Overview: think I squeaked by with everything working, HTML works but garbage
* REPL functionality works well with all features
* HTML functionality is there but needs better formatting
* Just one file of a couple tests
* Implementation is in a few big piles
* For next project, focus on components and testing as two sides of the same coin
