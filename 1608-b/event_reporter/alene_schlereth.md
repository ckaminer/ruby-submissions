Notes:
* 39 tests, tests all pass, however, the REPL starts in the testing.
* All functionality works. No extensions done.
* FILE IO should be in a separate class
* Used ERB.
* HTML Looks good. There is a table.
* Some classes do a bit much
* Don't print in the help file, puts at the outer most layer
* Think about what can be pulled out of a class in terms of functionality.
* Really liked how there was an attendee class.
