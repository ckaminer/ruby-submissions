Notes:
* Many improvements in testing suite (!!!), still some ways to go
* Basic use of enumerables, implementation required little use of enumerables
 
### 1. Functional Expectations
* 1: Application crashes during normal usage

### 2. REPL Interface
* 1: Application's REPL has enough problems as to make play difficult

### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

### 5. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

### 6. Enumerable & Collections
* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques

### 7. HTML and Style
N/A
