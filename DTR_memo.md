●	What are your learning goals for this project?
Anna: Learn how to use the canvas. Improve Javascript skills.
Christopher: Develop greater understanding of Javascript, especially regarding animations. Learn about
collision detection.


●	What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
Anna: Like to spend individual time solving new problems. Like to pair when someone is stuck, or during setup - working on features both people need to understand. Like to divide and conquer when we can separte work into clear areas.
Christopher: Flexible about pairing. Like to work together, especially when solving new problems. But also like time alone.

●	How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
Christopher: Specific, actionable, kind. Also, clear.
Anna: Agree with all that. Tend to ask a lot of questions to understand, not to cast aspersions on anyone else.

●	How would you describe your work style?
Anna: Need a good mix of individual and pairing time.
Christopher: I like to jump in and try and get it done. This can be a problem because I have a tendency, when I get stuck, to keep beating my head against a wall when I really need to take a break and come back fresh, or get another pair of eyes. These are situations where pairing is really helpful to me.

●	What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
Anna: Open and frequent communication are the projects that have gone the best.
Christopher: Group chemistry. I've been in some projects where people 'clicked' and others where people had difficulty seeing eye-to-eye.

●	What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
Anna: See collaboration and communication above.
Christopher: Good work environment. Secure in communication with partners.

●	What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
Anna: Very open. Want to spend time on the job search.
Christopher: Appointments on Wednesday and Thursday evening. Otherwise open schedule. Wrapping up the day by 7 or 8pm would be ideal.

●	What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
Anna: Very new to Javascript. Have a great deal to learn.
Christopher: Strength: Good at logical thinking. Area for improvement: Javascript. Also have a great deal to learn.

●	What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
Waffle. GitHub

●	How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
Both: Communicate in person or slack, and pair. Remember to ask Instructors for help.


●	How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
Anna: If we both learned a great deal and functioned as a successful team.
Christopher: The project is minimally successful if we accomplish the MVP requirements. But the goal is to complete the full spec.
