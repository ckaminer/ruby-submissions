# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[GitHub](https://github.com/seeker105/idea_box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/ideas.js#L124-L129)
This required exploring new JavaScript functionality that I was completely unfamiliar with. I used the debugger to check return values and function results. I had to experiment with triggering `focusout` and `blur` to see which produced the result I needed.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[GitHub](https://github.com/seeker105/idea_box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/ideas.js#L62-L87)
Waaay too much repetition.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

## Instructor Evaluation Points

### Specification Adherence

* **10 points**

### User Interface

* **5 points** - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

### Testing

* **5 points** - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. Not all controller actions are tested. There are little or no attempts at integration testing.

### Ruby and Rails Quality

* **8 points** - Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### JavaScript Style

* **8 points** - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


### Workflow

* **10 points** - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
