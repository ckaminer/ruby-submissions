## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

- User moves spaceship around screen
- Asteroids drift around screen randomly
- When spaceship collides with asteroid it dies
- Spaceship can shoot
- When an asteroid is shot, it breaks into smaller asteroids
- Smaller asteroids move faster
- Smaller asteroids continue to drift around
- Higher levels have more asteroids
- Higher levels the Asteroids move faster
- Have 'slow' zones where the ship moves slower
- Score possibilities:
  * Time Alive
  * Asteroids destroyed

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

- User moves spaceship around screen
- Asteroids drift around screen randomly
- When spaceship collides with asteroid it dies

### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In

* Goal 1: Asteroids drift around screen randomly (Asteroids warp around the screen)

* Goal 2: User moves spaceship around screen (turn and thruster. Stop moving when key is released.)

* Goal 3: When spaceship collides with asteroid it dies (spaceship disappears)

* Goal 4: Draw some kind of image to the canvas (player, asteroid, background) 

* Goal 5: Some tests



_Note: Instructor/Groups can add additional goals beyond 3. Grading for the next check in will be based on completion of goals_

### Stretch Goals

* Ship can shoot

* Asteroid splits on contact with bullet
