- Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
  Not really, but we are building a single background in Photoshop instead of trying to work with squares.
- Questions, Comments, Concerns?
  This is a preliminary draft, and will be finished so it looks better over the weekend.

### Goal: Populate first terrain with first row of veggies that move across the screen

- [Link to commit with goal accomplished](https://github.com/nickpisciotta/game-time/commit/f70d99c11d8159f4d571dd9ccc74b5a53d62836c)
- Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
  No. It also went according to the plan we had set in our first check-in
- Questions, Comments, Concerns?
  Currently, there is only the method to go right. Will fix.
  Looking at the game canvas, do you think there is anything we can do to make this portion of our board look better?
  Why have our tests broken for Obstacle? Can you assist us in figuring out what is happening with testing? It seems to be an issue with context in the testing environment.

### Goal: Collision is detected (doesn't have to be rendered) where child and veggies meet. (Note: If team focuses more on refactoring and testing then collision detection doesn't need to be fully done for next checkin)

- Link to commit with goal accomplished: Not yet accomplished
- Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
  Yes, this goal was listed as a stretch goal in our last check-in and we did not yet complete it, although we both did research last night about collision detection. We spent yesterday near the end of the day refactoring code, but we have created the game class to hold this logic.
- Questions, Comments, Concerns?
  What do you recommend for the best method for collision detection? How should we account for the fact that the veggies are moving very quickly?

## Next Steps?

- What do you feel the next steps should be?
Collision detection logic
Finish background and choose images for child and veggies.
Insert styling
Create start screen, level advance screen, etc.
Figure out how scoring should work

# Instructor Section

### Points for Second Check In (base 50)

* 60 points: Students documented their work well and completed all base goals or have documented where/why they deviated from the goal in a reasonable way. Students completed additional stretch goals.
* **50 points: Students documented their work well and completed all base goals or have documented where/why they deviated from the goal in a reasonable way.**
* 35 points: Students completed all base goals but did not document the work appropriately in their form || did not complete 1 goal and failed to document why in a reasonable way.
* 25 points: Students did not complete more than 1 goal.
* 0 points: Students did not complete check in form prior to eval.

### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In

* Goal 1: Collision Detection Logic (can check if player has collided with obstacle)

* Goal 2: Styling (Some basic CSS around the canvas, and child/veggies have images)

* Goal 3: Plan for Scoring

* Goal 4: Some indication of level ending


_Note: Instructor/Groups can add additional goals beyond 3. Grading for the next check in will be based on completion of goals_

### Stretch Goals

* Level advancement (Some congratulations message, and next level is more difficult)

### Feedback?
