# Game Time Check In # 1

## Basics

### Team
- [Nick Pisciotta](https://github.com/nickpisciotta)
- [Marcella Wigg](https://github.com/marcellawigg)

### Game Name

Cake Walk


### Give a Basic Description of the Game

The game will be resemble Frogger with a different theme: a child is crossing a pathway and trying to dodge vegetables, in an effort to reach an endpoint at which he can eat cake. We plan to include a second terrain on which the child must navigate where he must jump from junk food to junk food to survive.

### Include a Link to or Screen Shot of the Game

N/A

### Link to the Github repository for the project

## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

- Player crosses the path
- Obstructive objects (vegetables) are going across the screen, and player avoids them.
- Need to set Y-coordinate and X-coordinate limits so that player does not go offscreen and cannot go back.
- Player crosses second terrain, where you have to land on objects to be able to survive.
- You get points when you are successful in getting one of your objects to the endpoint.
- Three lives before level restarts.
- Next level after you've completed the minimum number of objects to the endpoint
- Time limit, as well as increasing object speed as levels progress.

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

(Cutting out second terrain if needed.)
- Player crosses the path
- Obstructive objects are going across the screen, and player avoids them.
- You get points when you are successful in getting one of your objects to the endpoint.
- Three lives before level restarts.
- Next level after you've completed the minimum number of objects to the endpoint

### What have you accomplished so far?

- We created a wireframe for our project to make the general format for our screen.
- Our plans for tonight are to come up with a creative theme for our project, and to find how to move a small block up, down, left, and right, without falling offscreen. We plan to be able to demo this tomorrow (today) in the check-in.

### Questions, Comments, Concerns?

* Do you have any ideas for how we might incorporate the suggested libraries into our project?
* Do you have any ideas to add complexity/layers?
* Why isn't our event listener responding

# Instructor Feedback Section

### Points for first check in (base 50)

* 50: First check in form and README was completed and pull requested in. Team has a well documented plan for moving forward with their game. Team has completed some wireframing and/or written code.
* 40: First check in form and README was completed and pull requested in. Team has a well documented plan for moving forward with their game. Team has not written any code or created any wireframe documents.
* 25: First check in form completed but shows little effort at documenting/planning and team has not written any code.
* 0: First check in form was not completed.

### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In

* Goal 1: Boundries where child cannot fall of the canvas/leave the play area

* Goal 2: Background for the canvas - may just be filled rectangles.

* Goal 3: Populate first terrain with first row of veggies that move across the screen.

* Goal 4: Collision is detected (doesn't have to be rendered) where child and veggies meet. (Note: If team focuses more on refactoring and testing then collision detection doesn't need to be fully done for next checkin)

_Note: Instructor/Groups can add additional goals beyond 3. Grading for the next check in will be based on completion of goals_

### Stretch Goals

* Wireframe win and lose conditions
* Avatar and images for the child and first row of veggies - first pass at implementing
