## Completion

### Do You Consider the Application to be Fully Playable?
 - The application is fully playable, minus a button that lets you replay the game. Right now users just have to refresh to replay the game.

### What Extensions, as Requested By an Instructor, Did You Complete?
- No extensions.

### What Features, if Any, Do You Feel Exceed Instructor Expectations?
- Our user interface looks baller, if we do say so ourselves.

----

## Risk Taking
- We took on the game without any idea of what it would entail and found it much more difficult than we expected.

## Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
- [DomManager](https://github.com/lucyfox4131/color-wars/blob/master/lib/dom_manager.js)
- We put a great effort into refactoring, because our game class contained most of the logic for rendering the pattern, determining whether the level was over, scoring, moving on to the next level, and rendering the appropriate things on the DOM. We broke out the logic for rendering onto the DOM into a DOM manager to make things much more isolated and easier to debug down the line.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
- [Calculating Color Values](https://github.com/lucyfox4131/color-wars/blob/995130e2b36965c2db7330fa937f241c11c11d64/lib/color_filler.js#L72-L89)
- This is a pretty long method that takes in many things and then makes variables from those things, which we're not a big fan of. It iterates through each block on the pattern and then checks if the block is either the user color, or one of the computer colors. Ideally this method would be flexible to iterate through any number of colors, thus getting rid of some repetition and making this more flexible. We just couldn't get this figured out in time. 

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

### Playability Features

We want your game to be full-featured and playable -- not just a proof of concept of the gameplay and rendering features.

To this end, make sure to include sufficient UX to allow the user to fully interact with the game. This would include:

- Indicate when the game is over and won or lost
- Allow the user to start a new game
- Include a clean UI surrounding the actual game interface itself
- Score Tracking: How this works will vary by game, but at the end of the game, generate a score for the winning player
- Scoreboard -- track scores across multiple game sessions. Since we aren't incorporating a server for our games, client-side storage like a cookie or LocalStorage will suffice.
- Create multiple rounds of difficulty. (consider increasing factors such as game speed, randomness of starting setup, etc)

### Features

* 35 points - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

### User Interface

* 15 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

### Testing

* 20 points - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* 20 points - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 25 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

* 15 points - Zero complaints
