### Link to the Github repository for the project

## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

- harder levels (more interesting patterns)
- visualization of relative of pattern filled by each color in real time
- extra user features like erase a color, add to the pattern, break the pattern
- add AI player / two players; first player places first dot instead of randomly placed dot (probably have to use web sockets?)

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

- One level
- very simple pattern (straight line)
- one color already exists (randomly placed)
- user places color point
- color race each other to fill pattern
- mobile first design

### What have you accomplished so far?
- Erin has worked on how to get lines to move across the Screen
- I've worked on generating game boards and pulling out x,y coordinates/general structure of application

### Questions, Comments, Concerns?
- Just general idea of how to structure application, doesn't seem like event listeners are working?, Would like to just run by general game play.
