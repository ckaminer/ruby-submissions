# Game Time Check In # 1

## Basics

### Team
- [Ryan Batty](https://github.com/riizu)
- [Parker Phillips](https://github.com/ExCaelum)

### Game Name

Seven Levels of Code 

### Basic Description

The player is presented with a procedurally generated "program" made up of seven levels of abstraction that are filled with malicious bugs, vulnerabilities, and exploits. They must make their way through the program, eventually clearing it for release.

## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

- Procedurally generated dungeons made up of variable rooms, an entrance, and exit
- Locked doors and keys
- A variety of enemies that the player must avoid or defeat
- Seven levels
- 32x Tileset art
- Smooth movement
- Intro tutorial level
- Character creation
- Additional Items

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

- Procedurally generated dungeon, made up of rooms, an entrance, and exit
- A movable player
- Basic flow of: Spawn -> Navigate -> Reach Exit -> Repeat
- Full collision detection with walls, exits, and enemies

### What have you accomplished so far?

- Planning and discussion
- DTR
- Repo and Waffle Creation
- Initial procedural generation research

### Future features (Let's talk about this next time)

- Enemies (kill player on contact, no actual combat)
- Smooth movement
- Where does UI belong? In canvas or in DOM?
- Enemy movement?
- What is visible? Line of sight? Light radius? Light cone?


### Questions, Comments, Concerns?
- Use of 3rd party libraries for generation

# Instructor Feedback Section

### Points for first check in (base 50)

* 50: First check in form and README was completed and pull requested in. Team has a well documented plan for moving forward with their game. Team has completed some wireframing and/or written code.
* 40: First check in form and README was completed and pull requested in. Team has a well documented plan for moving forward with their game. Team has not written any code or created any wireframe documents.
* 25: First check in form completed but shows little effort at documenting/planning and team has not written any code.
* 0: First check in form was not completed.

### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In

* Goal 1: Unit tested procedural generation of dungeon.

* Goal 2: Basic rendering of dungeon. Differentiate between walls, cooridors and rooms

* Goal 3: Player can move through cooridors and rooms, but not walls.

* Goal 4: Player can spawn and exit. Placements are random.

_Note: Instructor/Groups can add additional goals beyond 3. Grading for the next check in will be based on completion of goals_

### Stretch Goals

* Entrance and exit can be placed n number of tiles apart.
