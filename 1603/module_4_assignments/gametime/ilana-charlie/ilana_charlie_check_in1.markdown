## Basics

### Team

- [Charles Kaminer](https://github.com/ckaminer)

### Game Name

1603

### Give a Basic Description of the Game

Similar to 2048, with pictures of students of 1603 instead of numbers.

### Include a Link to or Screen Shot of the Game

## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

- Tiles move around the screen with arrow keys.
- When two tiles of the same picture hit together, they become a different picture.
- Each tile will also have a number value assigned.
- There will be a hierarchy of images to show what value they represent.
- When an arrow button is pushed, a new tile appears.
- The game ends when either the score 2048 (a certain person) or the board fills with tiles.
- When the game is won or lost, the game automatically resets with a "play again" button.
- Crazy Mode is instructor's pictures without a hierarchy of who is what number.
- The score increases when you add each tile together. 4+4 = 8 points.
- The session keeps track of the total score.

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

- Tiles move around the screen with arrow keys.
- Each tile will also have a number value assigned.
- When an arrow button is pushed, a new tile appears.
- The game ends when either the score 2048 or the board fills with tiles.
- When the game is won or lost, the game automatically resets with a "play again" button.

### What have you accomplished so far?

We have created a canvas and put some basic bootstrap into the project. We have also completed the logic for the game tiles, on paper.

### Questions, Comments, Concerns?

We are concerned about making the logic and animation pieces work together.

# Instructor Feedback Section

### Points for first check in (base 50)

* 50: First check in form and README was completed and pull requested in. Team has a well documented plan for moving forward with their game. Team has completed some wireframing and/or written code.

### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In

* Goal 1: Integration/Unit tests towards logic of nodes adjusting to getting right, left, up, down input

* Goal 2: First pass (doesn't have to be successful) of rendering nodes 

* Goal 3: Pair on some of the logic in the evil mode. 

### Stretch Goals

Don't panic.

Render an animation change.
