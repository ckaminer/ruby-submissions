### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In

* Goal 1: Nodes respond to arrow keys, including new values appearing

* Goal 2: Node values are viewable on screen

* Goal 3: Plan and stub out classes and functions for animation (What are the function names, and what do they do? (Who is your daddy, and what does he do?))

_Note: Instructor/Groups can add additional goals beyond 3. Grading for the next check in will be based on completion of goals_

### Stretch Goals

* Images instead of Rects and Text for Tiles/Nodes
