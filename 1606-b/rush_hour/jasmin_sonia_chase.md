## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 1.5: Application has some small missing base functionality
* 1.5: Application is not usable

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

#### 6. View Layer

* 2.5: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view
* 2.5: Application has messy views that mix logic and presentation

While you won't be graded on workflow for Rush Hour, here's an example of how you will be evaluated on workflow later in the module:

#### Workflow (NOT GRADED)

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.
* 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.
